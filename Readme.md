  * ## What is the Chain rule in derivative?
  * A vector is a specific type of tensor; tensors are a generalization, representing data in multiple dimensions,
  * while vectors are one-dimensional arrays (rank 1), and scalars are zero-dimensional (rank 0).
  * Think of it as a hierarchy: a scalar is a single number, a vector adds direction (1D array), and a tensor extends this to higher dimensions (2D matrix, 3D array, etc.),
  * representing more complex relationships like stress or curvature
