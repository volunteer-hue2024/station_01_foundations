## ⚡ 1. Calculus: Learn from mistakes (OPTIMIZATION)
Every model starts with wrong answers. Calculus tells the model how wrong it is and in which direction it must improve.
Calculus turns the learning process into a series of small, calculated steps that minimize error over time. The goal is to learn by slowly adjusting based on feedback.

* **Derivatives & Partial Derivatives:** The core of how models understand change.
    * [📺 Watch: What is a Derivative?](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxM-bQsoE2DiaIiZRn3Pq7SqrkeBSqRbt?si=hfngJjxgBg1B36Up)
* **The Chain Rule:** Essential for backpropagation in neural networks.

* **The Gradient:** Denotes the direction of greatest change in a scalar function.

## ⚡ 2. Linear Algebra: The Language of Data
Linear Algebra allows us to represent and manipulate massive datasets efficiently through various mathematical objects.

### Data Structures
| Object | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scalar** | Rank-0 tensor; magnitude only. | Temperature |
| **Vector** | Rank-1 tensor; magnitude and direction. | Velocity |
| **Tensor** | Higher-order generalization for complex data. | Stress, Inertia |

### Key Operations
* **Eigenvalues & Diagonalization:** Used to find the "important directions" in data where information is most concentrated.
* **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** Breaks data into essential components vs. noise.

## ⚡ 3. Probability: Managing Uncertainty
Probability allows models to move beyond "Yes/No" answers and understand the likelihood of events.
In probability, concepts like adding chances, multiplying chances, and understanding conditional probability are required.

* **Bayes’ Theorem:** Enables models to update their "beliefs" when new data arrives, allowing AI to evolve over time.
* **Distributions:** We use **PDFs** (Probability Density Functions) and **CDFs** (Cumulative Distribution Functions) to model data.
* **Common Distributions:** Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Bernoulli, and Binomial.

## ⚡ 4. Statistics: Making Sense of Data
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and presenting data to ensure models don't learn from "bad" data.

### Types of Statistics
1.  **Descriptive:** Understanding central tendency (Mean, Median) and variability (Standard Deviation, Variance).
2.  **Inferential:** Deciding whether patterns are real or just random noise using **Hypothesis Testing**.
3.  **Predictive:** Using **Correlation** and **Regression** to explain relationships.

## ⚡ 5. Discrete Mathematics: Logic & Rules
Discrete math focuses on clear rules and logic steps.
* **Example:** Calculating how many different paths a robot can take to reach a destination so the system can choose the most efficient one.
